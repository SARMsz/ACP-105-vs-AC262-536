<h1>ACP-105 vs AC262,536 – What’s Better for Gains & Recovery?</h1>

<p>I’ve personally tested <strong>ACP-105</strong> and <strong>AC262,536</strong> in solo cycles and in stacks. If you’re debating between the two, this guide is going to give you a real, no-BS look at how each one worked for me — what I gained, how I felt, and which one is worth it depending on your goals.</p>

<p>These are two of the newer SARMs on the market, and both are known for their low side effect profile. But that doesn’t mean they’re the same. One is definitely better for muscle and strength. The other is great for endurance and smooth results with almost no suppression.</p>

<h2>What Are These SARMs?</h2>

<h3>ACP-105</h3>
<p>ACP-105 is a partial androgen receptor agonist with a very strong anabolic-to-androgenic ratio. It's known for offering the muscle-building benefits of SARMs like LGD-4033, but with way less suppression. It also kicks in faster than most SARMs I’ve tried.</p>

<h3>AC262,536 (Accadrine)</h3>
<p>AC262,536 is one of the cleanest SARMs I’ve run. It binds less aggressively to non-muscle tissues, which helps reduce androgenic side effects like prostate enlargement or mood swings. Not the strongest SARM out there, but one of the easiest on the system.</p>

<h2>My Personal Cycle Logs: ACP-105 vs AC262,536</h2>

<h3>ACP-105 Results (8mg/day – 6 weeks)</h3>

<p>Week 1: Felt like nothing. Week 2: Sudden boost in gym performance. Pumps got more intense and I felt stronger fast. By week 4, I had gained just under 5 pounds of lean muscle — and I could see it in the mirror. Vascularity improved, and I felt tighter overall.</p>

<p>The surprising part? Recovery. This stuff made DOMS feel nonexistent. I could train push/pull/legs with only one rest day, and I still felt fresh. Sleep quality got better too.</p>

<p>No mood crashes. No libido dip. No lethargy. Slight suppression by the end (nothing serious), so I did a quick 3-week mini PCT with enclomiphene just in case.</p>

<p><strong>Best for:</strong> Lean bulking, strength, high-frequency training</p>

<p><strong>Where I got it:</strong> <a href="https://www.chemyo.com/product/acp-105-solution/?campaign=github&ref=166" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">ACP-105 from Chemyo</a></p>

<h4>Pros:</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Fast strength increases</li>
  <li>Very noticeable recovery improvements</li>
  <li>Clean, dry gains</li>
  <li>Low suppression</li>
</ul>

<h4>Cons:</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Not as strong as LGD or RAD for mass</li>
  <li>Requires mild PCT for some users</li>
</ul>

<h3>AC262,536 Results (30mg/day – 6 weeks)</h3>

<p>AC262,536 kicked in slower. I didn’t feel much until week 3. But when it started working, I noticed subtle improvements in muscle density, pumps, and especially endurance. This is the only SARM I’ve taken that made cardio easier.</p>

<p>I gained around 3–4 pounds — all lean, no water retention. Didn’t feel much suppression at all. Libido stayed normal, sleep was great, and mood was stable all cycle. Honestly, this one’s perfect for people who want results without any of the usual SARM baggage.</p>

<p>Downside? It’s not going to give you beast-mode strength or big mass gains. But it does enough to make your physique tighter and recovery smoother.</p>

<p><strong>Best for:</strong> Cutting, beginners, recomp, joint-friendly training</p>

<h4>Pros:</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Extremely low suppression</li>
  <li>Increases endurance and work capacity</li>
  <li>Dry, clean results</li>
  <li>No mental or hormonal sides</li>
</ul>

<h4>Cons:</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Slow to kick in</li>
  <li>Not ideal for bulking</li>
</ul>
